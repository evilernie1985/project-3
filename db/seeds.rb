# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Restaurant.create(name: "Macdonald's")
#
# Deal.create(name: "Free Ice-Cream", restaurant_id: 1)

Group.create(pax: 10, time: 1300, date: 20170814)
